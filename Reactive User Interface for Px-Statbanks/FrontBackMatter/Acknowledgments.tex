\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

In any project it is very important to have guidance. In this project we had Mr.Benadikt Joensen as our supervisor. We are very grateful for the help he provided us through this project from start to finish. 

We also want to give all our classmates that helped us with various problems that we encountered. 

We also want to give a special thanks to our classmates Fróði H. Joensen and Bergur I. Johansen for providing smart solutions when it came to the coding.

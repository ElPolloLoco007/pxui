\section{Technology}

Many technologies have been considered relevant to the project's web interface prototype.

In the end, Javascript has with related advanced Javascript frameworks has been chosen as the main programming language. JavaScript is one of the worlds most used front-end programming language\footnote{\href{http://blog.stoneriverelearning.com/top-10-programming-languages-used-in-web-development/}{Top 10 programming languages used in web development}\label{jstop10}} supported and implemented in all modern browsers with the support of new versions of the language. Addition to this, the React\footnote{\href{https://reactjs.org/}{Reactjs}\label{react}} library will be used for building the user interface. $React$ main maintainer is Facebook.

\centerline{\textit{Advantages regarding this project}}

\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{Popularity}] Huge active community of active developers.
\item [\textbf{Simplicity}] JavaScript is relatively simple to implement.
\item [\textbf{Documentation}] The documentation is very good and the resources to solve problems are numerous.
\item [\textbf{Network}] JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a back-end server and this is considered relevant since data fetching will be returned through API-calls from the statbank.
\item [\textbf{Speed}] JavaScript has no need to be compiled on the client side which gives it certain speed advantages to other programming languages.
\item [\textbf{Browser}] JavaScript is a scripting language which runs in the browser.
\item [\textbf{JSON}]The syntax of JavaScript Object Notation is based on JavaScript object syntax. 
\end{itemize}

\centerline{\textit{Disadvantages regarding this project}}

\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{Browser Support}] Client-side scripts can be a little unpredictable depending on the browser.
\end{itemize}

The disadvantages will be handled by tests.

\centerline{Other programming languages that where considered.}

\bigskip

\centerline{\textbf{TypeScript}}

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language.TypeScript  is both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features\footnote{\href{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/typescript_overview}{What is TypeScript}\label{whatIsTypeScript?}}.

\centerline{\textit{Disadvantages regarding this project}}
\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{Popularity}] The community of developers is smaller than in JavaScript. 
\item [\textbf{Step learning cure}] Learning curve is steeper than JavaScript with new syntax of typescript and strict typing.
\item [\textbf{False security}] It can provide false security in that it checks static type errors, but runtime errors can still occur.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\centerline{\textbf{ASP.NET}}

ASP.net is a framework for running web applications on the server. Applications that run on the server are used for processing data that you don't want to user to have access to.

\medskip
\centerline{\textit{Disadvantages regarding this project}}

\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{Server side}] This project is a client side project, while ASP.NET is used for server side applications. 
\end{itemize}

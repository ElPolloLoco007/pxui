\subsection*{PXWEB API}
The data in PX WEB APIs consists of a metadata part and a data part. Metadata is structured in a hierarchical node tree, where each node contains information about subnodes that are below it in the tree or, if the nodes are at the bottom of the tree structure, the data referenced by the node as well as what dimensions are available for the data at that subnode.
 
The API enables downloading and usage of data from statistical offices without using a web browser direct over HTTP/HTTPS.

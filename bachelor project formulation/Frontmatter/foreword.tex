\chapter{Foreword}
In the course 5025.16 KT-verkætlan (2018) we are required to make a project of our choosing, to learn how to create a project and write a report about it. This is done to prepare us to the bachelor project.

In this project we have included everything from building the radar, writing and understanding the code and showing how tests can be made from a ultrasonic sensor.

Doing this project helped us to understand and enhance our knowledge in starting a project, finding information about it and in the end write a report about it in LaTeX. Through this report we come to know about importance of team work and role of devotion towards the work.

In any project it is very important to have guidance. In this project we had Mr.Benadikt Joensen as our supervisor. We are very grateful for the help he provided us through this project from start to finish. 

We also want to give all our classmates that helped us with various problems that we encountered. 

We also want to give a special thanks to our classmates Fróði H. Joensen and Bergur I. Johansen for providing smart solutions when it came to the coding.
